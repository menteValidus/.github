# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Denis, a mobile developer who is always striving to improve my skills and build better apps.

## About Me

I have a passion for mobile development and I am always eager to learn new things. I enjoy working on projects that challenge me and help me grow as a developer. In my free time, I love experimenting with new technologies and building fun projects.

## Skills

Here are some of the skills I have developed over the years:

- Swift: I have extensive experience developing iOS apps using Swift. I am comfortable working with UIKit, SwiftUI, Core Data, and other core iOS frameworks.
- Kotlin: I have experience building Android apps using Kotlin. I am familiar with Android SDK, Android Studio, and other Android development tools.
- Python: I have been learning Python and using it for backend development. I have mainly worked with Flask.
- C#: I have experience working with C# and using it for building desktop apps using WPF and Unity for game development.
- GDScript: I love creating games using Godot engine and using GDScript for scripting.
- C++: I have basic understanding of C++ and can read and understand the code.

## Projects

I'm always seeking out new projects to enhance my skills and expand my knowledge. Currently, I'm working on the following:

- Todoshechka: This simple to-do application has two main objectives. The first is to create applications using both native and cross-platform frameworks, and the second is to compare the benefits and drawbacks of these frameworks in small prototypes. My progress on this project is as follows:
- [ ] [Swift](https://github.com/menteValidus/todoshechka): This project is currently in progress, and it is a native iOS app that uses the most up-to-date Apple frameworks.
  [ ] Kotlin: This native Android app employs the most up-to-date Android frameworks.
  [ ] KMM: This cross-platform app is intended to be used for both iOS and Android. The goal is to convert an existing Android app to KMM and utilize the UI from the Swift project.
  [ ] React Native: This cross-platform app is being developed from scratch. I want to try out this technology and gain first-hand knowledge of its benefits and drawbacks.
- Game Development: In my free time, I enjoy watching gamedev videos and creating small projects. One day, I hope to show off some of my work.
